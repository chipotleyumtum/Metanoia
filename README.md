# Metanoia: Webster Grove High School's own Open Sourced Application for Stability and Assesement.
Metanoia is Webster Grove's Open Sourced application that allows students, hack'ers, and literally anyone else to contribute to the making of the application that makes it easier for Webster Groves students to go on with their day to day activity at the local school.

- [ ] Decentralized 
  --As of now, its currently centralized due to a limited amount of functionality in the application itself.
