# Metanoia: Webster Grove High School's own Open Sourced Application for Stability and Assesement.
Metanoia is Webster Grove's Open Sourced application that allows students, hack'ers, and literally anyone else to contribute to the making of the application that makes it easier for Webster Groves students to go on with their day to day activity at the local school.

- [ ] Decentralized 
  --As of now, its currently centralized due to a limited amount of functionality in the application itself.

- [x] Open Sourced

- [ ] Encrypted (? (hopefully to update as the application is ongoing))

# Why Metanoia?
We fix things that cluster the local student from getting their brains together in one Application. Here are the problems that are caused to one's organization.
- Instagram: Too many accounts you need to go to and sometimes you would miss news and its just a whole mess
- Snapchat: Too many misinformation and unneccessary details spreading in the application. 
- Twitter: There are many taboo topics and unneccessary information that isn't to educate nor to provide the well being of a person
- Notepad: There isnt any updating factors that keep you up to date and its such a drag to even fill it in everyday!
- Canvas: Grades are scary, sometimes people dont even look at it because of grades, and also bugs that makes them log out unexpectedly!
